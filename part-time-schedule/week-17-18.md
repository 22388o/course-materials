# Weeks 17, 18

## Primary focus

This week, we will have Open Source maintainers and companies speak with us about their projects. 
This will help us better understand their projects from a technical perspective and enable us to 
contribute to those that interest us.

By the end of the week, you are expected to identify a project that suits your skills and gain industry 
experience by working on a real-world project.

### Open Source Projects

You are also advised to continue contributing to the Open Source projects that you found exciting.

### Personal Updates

Daily updates on your personal progress with projects and blog posts.

### Blog posts

You will continue to write and publish blog posts and give updates accordingly.
