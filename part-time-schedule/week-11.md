# Week 11

## Primary focus

Our goal this week will be to complete all Open Source Projects. We expect that you wrap up all the
issues you have been working on.

On Friday, we will hold a retro meeting to discuss the challenges and lessons learned from your open source work. It will be an opportunity for you to share your experiences, learn from each other, and reflect on your progress.

We wish you all the best as you work towards completing your open source projects this week.
