# Week 3

This week, we'll be starting "Mastering Lightning." This book will give you an understanding of the concepts and terminology used in the Lightning Network and prepare you for building on Lightning!

## Prerequisites

* LND should be installed and ready
* Developer environment from week 1 should be available. Having [Polar](https://lightningpolar.com) installed and functional is essential! It requires [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) to be installed.

## Goals

* Understand how the lightning network operates
  * Why it is thought of as a bitcoin "layer 2"
  * Where the trust in the system lies
  * What security assumptions it makes
  * How the various "layers" of the network fit together
  * Risks and benefits of using Lightning transactions
* Be familiar with sending and receiving lightning payments
* Understand how BOLT11 invoices work and what information they contain
* Understanding about BOLT12 offers, what the costs and benefits are, what alternatives are there?
* Thinking about how the bitcoin fee market can affect lightning channels

## Schedule

The book is available for free on the [author's GitHub](https://github.com/lnbook/lnbook). A web-reader-friendly hosted version of Mastering Lightning can be found at [lnbook.256k1.dev](https://lnbook.256k1.dev), which can be accessed for educational purposes using username and password `qala:lightning`.
