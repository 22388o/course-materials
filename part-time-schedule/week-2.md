# Week 2

This week, we'll be refreshing your knowledge on those aspects of the Bitcoin protocol that are most essential to becoming efficient and effective Bitcoin/LN builders. These materials (some more than others) will also be extremely helpful in better understanding the Mastering Lightning book in the next weeks.

## Schedule

The book is available for free on the [author's GitHub](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook), and the discussion questions are available on [Qala's GitHub](https://github.com/Qala-Dev/discussion-questions/tree/main/mastering-bitcoin). An overview of the questions for which you will be the discussion leader will be shared over the usual channels.

*Note: by Friday evening, we expect you to have finished the [Taproot workshop by Bitcoin Optech Group](https://bitcoinops.org/en/schorr-taproot-workshop/). It's quite a lot of work, so make sure to start early enough. As the new generation of Bitcoin builders, Taproot is a very powerful new tool that you're in a unique position to learn about and have at your disposal.*
