# Week 8

## Primary focus

This week the primary focus will be on Project 1 Retros and preparation for Project 
2 (Open Source Projects).

### Monday

We will start the week on Monday with completing Project 1 Demos and Retros. Demos are 
for those who did not demo their project last week and those with additional features 
(if time permits). We will also have a Review Session where you will share the things 
you learned while working on Project 1 as well as its challenges and improvements you 
think can be made.

### Wednesday

On Wednesday, we'll have a contributing etiquette Workshop that will prepare us on how to 
contribute to Open Source Projects. It will also look at how to polish our Projects on Github 
covering Readme, Licence, Contribution guidelines amongst others.

##### Design Document

After the workshop, you are expected to identify a project to work on alongside specific issues, design 
and submit a Document for approval before proceeding to start making contributions.
 

### Personal Updates

### Blog posts
