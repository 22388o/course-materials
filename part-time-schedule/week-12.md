# Week 12

## Primary focus

Our focus this week will be to wrap up all Open Source Contributions. If you are still working on your contribution, you are expected to complete them this week. If you have completed some contributions, then we encourage you to keep finding more issues to work on.

On Friday, we will hold a retro and demo session where you present the contribution(s) you made, show your PR and give a retro of the challenges and lessons learned from your Open Source work as well as ideas for improvement. It will be an opportunity for you to share your experiences and learn from each other.

We wish you all the best as you work towards completing your Open Source projects this week.
