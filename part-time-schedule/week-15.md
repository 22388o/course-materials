# Week 15


## Primary focus

This week, we will continue working on Project 2. If you have implemented your projects' MVP, then it
is time to add other features and complete your project. However, if you haven't, you should aim to
deliver your project's MVP before Friday for demo.

On Monday, we will have Office hours where you can share any challenge you might be facing with your 
project.

Consider reaching out to your team members or instructors if you need additional support or guidance.

### Open Source Projects

found exciting.

### Personal Updates

Daily updates on your personal progress with projects and blog posts.

### Blog posts

You will continue to write and publish blog posts and give updates accordingly.
