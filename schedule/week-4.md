# Week 4

## Primary focus

This week the primary focus will be on completing your first project / continuing on with your second project.

## Reading and presentation

Although we have finished the scheduled reading this week, we would like you to form groups, read a little into a specific topic, then with your group form an overview of the topic and your thoughts on it, finishing by presenting your thoughts to the group.

More information can be found on the presentation topics [page](../presentation-topics.md).

## Seminar chaperones

You will chaperone the _next_ group of developers through the Chaincode study groups, and then the seminars themselves.

These will be run as follows:

    * run at half speed
    * half a topic per day
    * you will be assigned a question, discuss with 1 other and present to the group

Qala will try to arrange for some guest stars to come and join us all for the question time!
