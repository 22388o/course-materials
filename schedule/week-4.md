# Week 4

## Seminar chaperones

You will chaperone the _next_ group of developers through the Chaincode study groups, and then the seminars themselves.

These will be run as follows:

    * run at half speed
    * half a topic per day
    * you will be assigned a question, discuss with 1 other and present to the group

Qala will try to arrange for some guest stars to come and join us all for the question time!
