# Week 3

## Mornings

Continue with a chapter per day of Mastering Lightning, as detailed below.

A web-reader-friendly hosted version of Mastering Lightning can be found at [lnbook.256k1.dev](https://lnbook.256k1.dev), which can be accessed for educational purposes using username and password `qala:lightning`.

Assigned groups and discussion questions are [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xE9ZHMB-pd6LSWcBCRj2sfx5lDnvvnfzasarFHy2ugo) and the book should be read in the following order:

| Day       | Chapters |
| --------- | -------- |
| Monday    | -        |
| Tuesday   | 9        |
| Wednesday | 12       |
| Thursday  | 15       |
| Friday    | -        |

If you finish your chapter(s) for the day early, feel free to move on to the next day's chapter(s), as repetition is key when it comes to absorbing so much knowledge.

If you finish all the chapters, you should read the remaining chapters in the following order:

11 -> 17 -> 5 -> 10 -> 13 -> 14 -> 16

## Afternoons

The primary focus during this week, now that the study materials and time allotted for study is coming to an end will be on building, building and more building.

This will include selecting additional projects from the [project](../projects.md) list, or expanding, refining or improving a project you have already started with additional functionality.

We will also be looking for developers to remove strong dependency on underlying bitcoin/lightning libraries in projects worked on in this week.This is in order to demonstrate strong understanding of the bitcoin/lightning heavy lifting that these libraries do for us.
Alternatively developers could demonstrate strong understanding by contributing changes upstream to the underlying libraries themselves.

## Building Lightning Apps Workshop

Please try to complete this on Tuesday or Wednesday of this week.
You will need [Polar](https://lightningpolar.com/) installed and working for the workshop.

Follow along with Brian Mancini's "Building a Lightning Graph" workshop which can be found [here](https://github.com/bmancini55/building-lightning-graph).
There is documentation for the workshop [here](https://github.com/bmancini55/building-lightning).

## Project demos

We are reserving 30 minutes on Thursday (and every Tuesday and Thursday in the following weeks) right after the daily standup for demo time!

Read all about them on https://course.qala.dev/meetings and reserve your slot once you've got something to share.
Demos don't need to be perfect or beautiful, just let us all share in your excitement and experience!
