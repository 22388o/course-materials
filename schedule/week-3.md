# Week 3

The full schedule for week 3 will be released closer to the time, as it is partially based on current rates of progress of the group through the first two weeks, which involved both a lot of study and a lot of building.

The primary focus during this week, now that the study materials and time allotted for study is complete, will be on building.
This may include selecting additional projects from the project list, or expanding, refining or improving a project you have already started.

We will also be looking for developers to be removing their dependency on bitcoin/lightning libraries in projects worked on in this week (or alternatively be contributing changes to the underlying libraries themselves).
This is in order to demonstrate strong understanding of the bitcoin/lightning heavy lifting that these libraries do for us.

## Seminar chaperones

In week 3 the Qala developers (you!) will chaperone the _next_ group of developers through the Chaincode study groups, and then the seminars.
These will be run as follows:
    * run at half speed
    * half a topic per day
    * you will be assigned a question, discuss with 1 other and present to the group

Qala will try to arrange for some guest stars to come and join us all for the question time!
