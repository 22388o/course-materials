## Cryptography

In a Bitcoin context the chapters on [Digital Signatures](https://cryptobook.nakov.com/digital-signatures) and specifically [ECDSA Signatures](https://cryptobook.nakov.com/digital-signatures/ecdsa-sign-verify-messages) are well-worth reading, as is the chapter on [Hash Functions](https://cryptobook.nakov.com/cryptographic-hash-functions).

In a lightning context, and in addition to the above, its worth also reading the [MAC and Key Derivation](https://cryptobook.nakov.com/mac-and-key-derivation) and [ECDH Key Exchange](https://cryptobook.nakov.com/asymmetric-key-ciphers/ecdh-key-exchange) chapters, both of which are used as [part](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/master/08-transport.md#cryptographic-messaging-overview) of the encrypted transport layer.
