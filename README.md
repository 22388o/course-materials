# Course

The course starts off by being organised at a daily granularity, moving into a weekly schedule after bitcoin and lightning study sessions have been concluded.

Progression through the first two weeks begins in a roughly linear fashion, devolving into self-led study and building as the focus moves on to the project-led section of the course.
